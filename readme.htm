		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>This document accompanies Java 1.0 release of the 'HandCoded Toolkit for FpML 
			Processing' and describes the contents of the release area. The source code for 
			this release is not included but is available from the SVN repository on 
			SourceForge.</p>
		<h2>License</h2>
		<p>This toolkit is distributed under the terms if the 'Open Source License 
			"OSL"&nbsp; Version 3.0'. A full copy of the license terms is included in the 
			repository (click <a href="license.txt" target="_blank">here</a> to access) and 
			must be distributed along with this file if you distribute this code to other 
			parties.</p>
		<H2>Directory Structure</H2>
		<P>The ZIP file that contained this release expands into a number of files and 
			sub-directories. The following briefly describes the purpose of each.
		</P>
		<UL class="L1">
			<LI>
			readme.html (The file you are reading)
			<LI>
				license.txt<BR>
				<BR>
			A copy of the license terms under which the toolkit is distributed.

				handcoded.jar<BR>
				<BR>
			This file contains all compiled Java class files for the toolkit and its 
			demonstration applications.
			<LI>
				example.bat<BR>

			Running this file will execute a simple batch validation of a selection of FpML 
			examples. Examples prior to FpML 4.2 contain some mistakes and a few will 
			output error messages.

				Contains a subdirectory for each version of the FpML as well as the schema for

				A set of XML data files containing the scheme code values defined by FpML for 
				each release and a set of additional definitions for currency and country 
				codes.
				<LI>
					examples<BR>
					<BR>
				A copy of the FpML example file for each schema release. Some may contain 
				mistakes as many have not been properly validated.
				<LI>
					test-cases<BR>
					<BR>
					A copy of the FpML validation test files for&nbsp;both valid and invalid case. 
					It is important to note some valid test cases still generate errors, just not 
					the one they are supposed to test.</LI></UL>

		<H2>Example Applications</H2>
		<p>The toolkit is provided with a simple test application (implemented in the class 
			demo.com.handcoded.fpml.Validate) that demonstrates its performance. Running 
			the example batch file will process a small selection of FpML examples 
			displaying the results to the screen.</p>
		<P>At the end of the run the program calculates the average processing &nbsp;time 
			for each file and displays the number of rules tested against each file as 
			shown below.</P>
		<PRE>&gt;&gt; files/examples/fpml4-0/ird_ex26_fxnotional_swap_with_cfs.xml<BR>&gt;&gt; files/examples/fpml4-0/ird_ex27_inverse_floater.xml<BR>&gt;&gt; files/examples/fpml4-0/ird_ex28_bullet_payments.xml<BR>&gt;&gt; files/examples/fpml4-0/msg_ex01_request_confirmation.xml<BR>&gt;&gt; files/examples/fpml4-0/msg_ex02_trade_confirmed.xml<BR>&gt;&gt; files/examples/fpml4-0/msg_ex03_portfolio.xml<BR>&gt;&gt; files/examples/fpml4-0/td_ex01_simple_term_deposit.xml<BR>&gt;&gt; files/examples/fpml4-0/td_ex02_term_deposit_w_settlement_etc.xml<BR>== Processed 91 files in 1391 milliseconds<BR>== 65.42056074766356 files/sec checking 219 rules</PRE>
		<P>The application responds to a number of command line options and can be 
			configured to test the FpML defined rules (e.g. excludes HandCoded rules 
			including scheme value checking) or to use a more streamlined XML parsing 
			technique that only supports schema based instances from FpML 4.0 or later. The 
			default configuration is to process both DTD and schema based instances which 
			is less efficient.</P>
		<P>Futures releases will add further demonstration applications</P>
		<H2>Support</H2>
		<P>If you find a problem using toolkit then please use the forum and bug reporting 
			facilities on the <A href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/fpml-toolkit">SourceForge 
				project</A> site to record the issue.</P>
